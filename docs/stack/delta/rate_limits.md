# Rate Limits

Revolt uses a fixed-window ratelimiting algorithm:
- You are given a set amount of calls per each named bucket.
- Any calls past this limit will result in 429 errors.
- Buckets are replenished after 10 seconds from initial request.

## Buckets

There are distinct buckets that you may be calling against, none of these affect each other and can be used up independently of one another.

| Method | Path | Limit |
|--:|---|:-:|
| | `/users` | 20 |
| | `/bots` | 10 |
| | `/channels` | 15 |
| `POST` | `/channels/:id/messages` | 10 |
| | `/servers` | 5 |
| | `/auth` | 3 |
| `DELETE` | `/auth` | 255 |
| | `/swagger` | 100 |
| | `/*` | 20 |

## Headers

There are multiple headers you can use to figure out when you can and cannot send requests, and to determine when you can next send a request.

| Header | Type | Description |
|---|:-:|---|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | `number` | Maximum number of calls allowed for this bucket. |
| `X-RateLimit-Bucket` | `string` | Unique identifier for this bucket. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | `number` | Remaining number of calls left for this bucket. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset-After` | `number` | Milliseconds left until calls are replenished. |

## Rate Limited Response

When you receive `429 Too Many Requests`, you will also receive a JSON body with the schema:

```typescript
interface Response {
    // Milliseconds until calls are replenished
    retry_after: number
}
```
