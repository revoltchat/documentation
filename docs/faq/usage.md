## Brand Guidelines

In general:
- The Revolt branding is used to represent the platform, revolt.chat.
- You may use the branding as-is to promote the platform and your community on the platform.
- You should not use the branding in order to appear as if you are associated with the Revolt team.
- Please make explicit distinctions between Revolt (the platform, "revolt.chat") and the Revolt software.
- The Revolt software is unbranded and only associated by name.

If you have any concerns or questions, please liase with us at [hello@revolt.chat](hello@revolt.chat).
