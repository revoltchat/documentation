# 2. Why another project?

To preface this entry, I would say, first and foremost, Revolt is a passion project.<br/>Obviously, it's grown way more than we've ever imagined it to, and we are continuing to work hard and grow the platform even further, so given we're already here, we might as well keep going.

People also often ask why we wouldn't just contribute to a new project, really there's two main things I would split that into.

### Learning Experience

Revolt has really taught me **a lot** about different concepts and programming languages, and really, that's how developers learn. We make cool projects to try to better how we work, it doesn't matter if someone has done it before as long as you can attempt to do the same. Reinventing the wheel is part of the process.

### Void of Competition

Discord doesn't actually have much of viable competitors in its own specific genre of chat platform, we're just sort of filling the void. I think we have a pretty solid shot at making our mark.
