# 6. What can I do with Revolt?

## Brand Guidelines

In general:
- The Revolt branding is used to represent the platform, revolt.chat.
- You may use the branding as-is to promote the platform and your community on the platform.
- You should not use the branding in order to appear as if you are associated with the Revolt team.
- Please make explicit distinctions between Revolt (the platform, "revolt.chat") and the Revolt software.
- The Revolt software is unbranded and only associated by name.

If you have any concerns or questions, please liase with us at [hello@revolt.chat](mailto:hello@revolt.chat).

## Guidelines for Third Party Instances

  - If you are modifying the software and using it in production, you must publish the changes to the source publicly in line with [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html). (In addition to providing attribution back to the original project.)
- You are **solely responsible** for whatever happens on your third party instance, we provide no warranty or liability for what happens on 3rd party instances.
